useref hook
- Timer with useRef
Create a simple timer that starts when a "Start" button is clicked and stops when a "Stop" button is clicked, but without re-rendering the component on every timer update.

Steps:
Use useState for the display of the timer.
Use useRef to store the timer's ID and track the time.
Implement the logic to start, stop, and clear the timer without causing re-renders on each tick.
